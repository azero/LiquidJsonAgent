# LiquidJsonAgent
A simple agent for Plex, uses simple json files to supply meta data.

# How To Use
Each file need's to be in its own folder with a Info.json file located in the same directory. It will read the json files and update the meta data. See the example directory for example json files.

The collection needs to be set to type Movies with the agent set as LiquidJsonAgent.

Copy the LiquidJsonAgent.bundle folder into your Plex plug-ins folder. On my Raspbberry Pi install it is located at "/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins".

# Example Uses
To index a collection of YouTube videos.
Tag and catalog family movies.
etc, etc.
