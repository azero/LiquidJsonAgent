# LiquidJsonAgent
A simple agent for Plex, uses simple json files to supply meta data.

Each file needs to be in its own folder with a Info.json file located in the same directory. It will read the json files and update the meta data.

Copy the LiquidJsonAgent.bundle folder into your Plex plug-ins folder. On my Raspbberry Pi install it is located at "/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins"
